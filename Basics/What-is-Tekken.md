# What is Tekken?
Tekken is a 3D fighting game developed by Bandai Namco and is available on
[PS4](https://amzn.com/B01GW8WUMO) and
[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/389730/TEKKEN_7/).
What separates Tekken from 2D fighting games is the addition of the third dimension.
Tekken eliminates the air game complexity of 2D fighters and chooses to
focus on complex ground movement instead. This movement is one of the reasons
that Tekken is so fun to play and watch. Tekken also includes various intricate
mechanics, including walls, which can wildly change your approach to match-ups.
