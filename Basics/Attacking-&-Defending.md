# Attacking & Defending

effect instead of yellow like regular mids" %}

Despite every character having their arsenal of unique attacks, everyone
follows the same rules. Unlike 2D fighting games, Tekken uses four attack
types: high, mid, special mid, and low. Since the air-game complexity of 2D
fighting games has been removed, having only high and low hit types makes
defending far too simple. By introducing mids, you have a good reason not to
duck since mids are typically quite powerful.

## Blocking

### Neutral Guard
If you're not inputting any directions, the game considered you to be in neutral
<span class="no-break">(<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/n.svg">)</span>.
While in neutral, you passively block high and mid attacks. Neutral guard is a legacy Tekken
mechanic and it's dangerous to rely on it since certain strings
break neutral guard. An example of this is Heihachi's
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/uf.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/3.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/4.svg">
</span>.
If you're neutral guarding, you'll block the first kick and be hit by the second.

### Active Guard
To stop this neutral guard break nonsense from occurring in the first place,
active guard instead by holding
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/bh.svg">.
Active guarding blocks attacks in situations where neutral guard won't,
for example, in the While Standing stance. In While Standing, neutral guarding
won't block any attacks whereas active guarding will.

### Crouch Guarding
Lows are a great way to sneak in damage since a majority of them are
close to the threshold of human reaction time, and they ignore standing guard.
Some lows, such as the Hellsweep, are considered "unseeable", meaning they hit
you so quickly that you cannot react in time to block. To block lows, hold
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/dbh.svg">.
</span>
You can also neutral guard while
crouching by holding
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/dh.svg">, but this suffers from the same
issues as standing neutral guard.
