# Attacking & Defending
Despite every character having their arsenal of unique attacks,
everyone follows the same rules. Tekken uses four attack types: high, mid,
special mid, and low, which varies from 2D fighting games.
Since the air-game complexity has been removed, having only high
and low hit types would be far too simple. By introducing mids,
you have a good reason not to duck continuously.
