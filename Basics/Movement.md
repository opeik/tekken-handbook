At its core, Tekken is a game about movement. Defensive movement allows you to
make attacks miss entirely, and offensive movement can be used to force the
opponent into a dangerous mixup situation. Incorporating movement into your
strategies is vital.

## Basic movement
### Dashing

<div>
  <span>
  Similar to other fighting games, you can dash to quickly create or close space
  between you and your opponent. Assuming you're facing right,
  </span>
  <div class="icon-b"></div>
  <div class="icon-b"></div>
  <span>
  will perform a backdash and
  </span>
  <div class="icon-f"></div>
  <div class="icon-f"></div>
  <span>
  will perform a forward dash. If you're being pressured by your opponent, a
  well placed backdash can cause their attacks to miss (also known as whiffing),
  granting you a chance to counter attack.
