At its core, Tekken is a game about movement. Defensive movement allows you to
make attacks miss entirely, and offensive movement can be used to force the
opponent into a dangerous mixup situation. Incorporating movement into your
strategies is vital.

Unlike other fighting games, Tekken allows you to **instantly cancel movement
into other movement**, meaning there is little commitment to moving. At any point you
can cancel a sidestep or forward dash into blocking, or immediately retreat by
cancelling it into a back dash.

## Dashing
Like most fighting games, to win a round, you need to deplete the
opponent's life gauge by dealing damage. You can't just run at the opponent
though since you're not able to guard while moving forwards. The opponent's
long range moves will clip you before you can close in.

So how can we damage the opponent? One method is to enter your opponent's attack range to bait them
into attacking, then step out immediately. If executed properly, the opponent's
attack will miss, which is known as whiffing. Whiffing in Tekken is extremely
dangerous since you cannot block until the recovery animation ends.
Attacking your opponent after they whiff while they cannot block is
called a "whiff punish".

Dashing allows you to create or close space between you and your opponent very
quickly. To back dash, input

, and to forward dash, input

. By holding the

,  you will block while back dashing.
Since back dashing allows you to make your opponent's moves whiff, and you're
blocking at the same time, it negates several of your opponent's offensive
options at once.

## Side stepping
Your opponent may have specific attacks which you can't make whiff by back
dashing. For example, moves with exceptionally long range, or lows,
which ignore standing guard. The answer to defeating these attacks is side
stepping.

Every attack in Tekken tracks a certain amount, from
none to homing, which will track approximately 180Â° in front of you.
The more an attack tracks, the better chance it has to hit if your opponent is side
stepping. Typically in Tekken, if back dashing is not effective,
side step instead since these attacks usually have poor tracking.
To sidep step, input
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/u.svg">
or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/d.svg">
to move into the background and foreground, respectively.
You may also hear this referred to as side step left, or side step right.
Left and right are relative to your character, for example:
if you're facing right, side step left would be into the background.

Unlike back dashing, you are unable to block during a side step.
This vulnerability is an apparent distinction to make. Side stepping carries
far more risk than back dashing but has a higher chance to cause an attack
to whiff since you're moving laterally. Despite not being able to block,
you're not as vulnerable as it appears. A surprising amount of attacks have
little tracking. A short side step cancelled into blocking allows you to
make attacks whiff while being relatively low risk.

Generally speaking, you want to step "with" an attack; meaning you step the
the direction the attack is going.
For example: if the opponent's attack moves towards your right, you should side step right.
There are exceptions to every rule in Tekken though: the Electric Wind God Fist,
which is one of Kazuya's key moves, requires you to step into the attack to make
it whiff.

The direction that you're stepping matters. Stepping attacks at random will more
than likely cause you to get hit. Attacks in Tekken typically track well in one
direction, but poorly to the other. Furthermore, characters generally have one
side that a majority of their key attacks track poorly to. You can make
a majority of your opponent's offensive options whiff by stepping to their weak
side.

Stepping to your opponent's weak side forces them to use homing attacks, which track
extremely well to both directions.
As you can probably guess, homing attacks also have a caveat. If they're fast,
they're typically high. If they're mid, they're generally slow or are punishable on block.
High attacks can be ducked and punished. You can defeat slow, mid homing attacks by
a short sidestep cancelled into blocking. Fast mid homing
attacks will shut down stepping very effectively.
If you suspect one is coming, and block it, you can block punish it.
