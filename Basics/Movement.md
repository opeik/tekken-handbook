# Movement
At its core, Tekken is a game about movement. Defensive movement allows you to
make attacks miss entirely, and offensive movement can be used to force the
opponent into a dangerous mixup situation. Incorporating movement into your
strategies is vital.

Unlike other fighting games, Tekken allows you to instantly cancel movement
into other movement, meaning there is little commitment to moving. At any point you
can cancel a forward dash into a sidestep, or retreat by cancelling into a back dash.

## Back Dash
### Creating Space
Like most fighting games, to win a round, you need to deplete the
opponent's life gauge by dealing damage. You can't just run at the opponent
though since you're not able to guard while moving forwards. The opponent's
long range attacks will clip you before you can close in.

So how can we damage the opponent? One method is to enter your opponent's attack range to bait them
into attacking, then step out immediately. If executed properly, the opponent's
attack will miss, which is known as whiffing. Whiffing in Tekken is extremely
dangerous since you cannot block until the attacks recovery animation ends.
Attacking your opponent after they whiff while they cannot block is
called a "whiff punish".

### Input
Back dashing allows you to create space between you and your opponent very
quickly. To back dash, input
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/b.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/bh.svg">
</span>.
By holding the <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/bh.svg">, you will block while back dashing.
Since back dashing allows you to make your opponent's attacks whiff, and you're
blocking at the same time, it negates several of your opponent's offensive
options at once.

### Korean Back Dash
While you can cancel movement into movement, you can't cancel a back dash into
another back dash. The technique to work around this limitation is known as
the "Korean Back Dash" or "Back Dash Cancel".
While you can't cancel a back dash into itself, you can duck instead.
Because of this property, you can back dash, duck, then back dash
again.

To Korean Back Dash, input:
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/b.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/bh.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/db.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/n.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/then.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/b.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/bh.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/db.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/n.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/then.svg">
</span> and so on. Korean Back Dashing is
an essential technique since it allows you to create far
more space than a single back dash. A good target is three back dashes in a row,
so get practising.

## Sidestep
Your opponent may have specific attacks which you can't make whiff by back
dashing. For example, attacks with exceptionally long range, or lows,
which ignore standing guard. The answer to defeating these attacks is side
stepping.

### Tracking
Every attack in Tekken tracks a certain amount, from
none to homing, which will track approximately 180Â° in front of you.
The more an attack tracks, the better chance it has to hit if your opponent is side
stepping. Typically in Tekken, if back dashing is not effective,
sidestep instead since these attacks usually have poor tracking.

### Input
To side step, input
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/u.svg">
or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/d.svg">
to move into the background and foreground, respectively.
You may also hear this referred to as sidestep left, or sidestep right.
Left and right are relative to your character, for example:
if you're facing right, sidestep left would be into the background.

{% include video.html url="SpottedQuarterlyColt" class="float-left float-figure"
description="Back dashing is dangerous against lows such as the Hellsweep;
however, it is vulnerable to sidewalk left" %}
### Caveats
Unlike back dashing, can't block during a sidestep.
This vulnerability is an apparent distinction to make. Sidestepping carries
far more risk than back dashing but has a higher chance to cause an attack
to whiff. Despite not being able to block,
you're not as vulnerable as it appears. A surprising amount of attacks have
little tracking. A short sidestep cancelled into blocking allows you to
make attacks whiff while being relatively low risk.

### Stepping Correctly
Generally speaking, you want to step "with" an attack; meaning you step the
the direction the attack is going.
For example: if the opponent's attack moves towards your right, you should sidestep right.
There are exceptions to every rule in Tekken though: the Electric Wind God Fist,
which is one of Kazuya's key attacks, requires you to step into the attack to make
it whiff.

The direction that you're stepping matters. Stepping attacks at random will more
than likely cause you to get hit. Attacks in Tekken typically track well in one
direction, but poorly to the other. Furthermore, characters generally have one
side that a majority of their key attacks track poorly to. You can make
a majority of your opponent's offensive options whiff by stepping to their weak
side.

### Mindgames

{% include video.html url="KindlyBestGourami" class="float-right float-figure"
description="Stepping into an attack will cause you to get hit, whereas stepping with
the attack will make it whiff" %}

Stepping to your opponent's weak side forces them to use homing attacks, which track
extremely well to both directions.
As you can probably guess, homing attacks also have a caveat. If they're fast,
they're typically high. If they're mid, they're generally slow or are punishable on block.
High attacks can be ducked and punished. You can defeat slow, mid homing attacks by
a short sidestep cancelled into blocking. Fast mid homing
attacks will shut down stepping very effectively. However, they are generally
unsafe on block. You can't throw out unsafe attacks too recklessly since your
opponent gets free damage if they block and punish.

These mechanics create an elaborate mind game where both you and your opponent
are trying to make attacks whiff, as well as trying to stop the other from
moving to prevent your attacks from whiffing.

### Sidewalk
Certain attacks, while steppable, require you to sidewalk instead of sidestep to
make them whiff. Sidewalking moves you further laterally than sidestepping.
To sidewalk, input
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/u.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/uh.svg">
</span>
or
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/d.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/dh.svg">
</span>
to move into the background and foreground, respectively. You will continue to
sidewalk as long as you hold the button. You can also think of the input as
Sidestep
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/uh.svg"> or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/dh.svg">, as in you're cancelling a sidestep
into a sidewalk. A sidewalk can occur at any time during a sidestep.

## Duck

{% include video.html url="SilentHorribleGordonsetter" class="float-right float-figure"
description="While ducking, you crush highs, block lows, but are vulnerable to mids" %}

To duck, hold <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/dbh.svg">. While you're
ducking, high attacks can't hit you. This property is called "high crushing".
You will also block lows, but can't block mids.
Mid attacks generally deal a lot of damage
and since you can't block mids while ducking, it's dangerous to
randomly duck. Similarly to back dashing and sidestepping, you must duck with intent.
Either you suspect a powerful high is coming or you know there is a high attack
in a string.

## Forward Dash
To forward dash, input
<span class="no-break">
    <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/f.svg">
    <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/f.svg">
</span>
. Forward dashing lets you quickly close in space between you and your opponent.
Whenever you forward dash, you realign with your opponent. When you realign,
your character will immediately turn to face the opponent. Realigning can be
helpful if your opponent is aggressively sidestepping. You cannot block while forward dashing.

## Crouch Dash
To crouch dash, input
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/f.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/n.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/d.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/df.svg">
</span>.
Similarly to forward dashing, crouch dashing lets you quickly approach your opponent,
and will realign. Unlike forward dashing, you can perform character-specific crouch dash attacks
by pressing a button while crouch dashing. Mishima's, for example, have access
to the powerful Hellsweep and Electric Wind God Fist from a crouch dash.
You cannot block while crouch dashing.

## Run
To run, input
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/f.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/fh.svg">
</span>
. Running lets you close space faster than forward dashing. You cannot block
while running. There is a distance requirement to run, unlike forward dashing, so you cannot
run while right next to your opponent. You can also perform running attacks,
which will be covered soon.

## Walk
By holding
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/fh.svg"> or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/bh.svg">, you'll slowly walk towards or away
from your opponent. Since walking is so slow, you aren't advised to do it.
Back dash or forward dash instead. Walking backwards walking *can* be useful if you have
nerves in a scramble situation and you're struggling to back dash.

## Jump
Unless you're playing Akuma, Geese or Eliza, don't jump. Since Tekken 3, the
anti-gravity moon jump has been toned down to a stumpy hop which is more or less
useless (outside of certain okizeme situations).
You cannot block while jumping, and your opponent can hit you out of
the air for a combo, which is known as a "float" combo. To jump, hold
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/uh.svg">
. You can also hold
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/ubh.svg">
or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/ufh.svg">
to jump backwards and forwards, respectively.
