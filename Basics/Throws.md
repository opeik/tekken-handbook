# Throws
It can be challenging to break through the guard of extremely defensive players
(also known as turtling). One method to opening up opponents
is by using throws. Throws cannot be blocked, and most are high (except a
handful which are mid). Because throws ignore guard, they are a reliable option
against turtling, or to mix up your offence.

## Breaking Throws
While throws cannot be blocked, you can break most of them. To break standing
throws you need to press the buttons corresponding to what arms your
opponent extends. You only have one opportunity to break a throw. If you input
the incorrect throw break it becomes unbreakable and the damage is guaranteed.
