# Throws
It can be challenging to break through the guard of defensive players.
One method of opening up opponents is by using throws.
Throws are high (except for crouching and ground throws), can't be
blocked but can be broken. Because throws ignore guard, they are a reliable option
against turtling or to mix up your offence.

## Generic Throw
Every character has access to at least two generic throws as well as
long-range versions of them.
To perform a generic throw, input
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1+3.svg"> or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2+4.svg">. If you'd like to stay on the same
side, use the <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1+3.svg"> throw.
Alternatively, the <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2+4.svg"> throw will swap
sides with your opponent.
To perform a long-range generic throw, input
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/f.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1+3.svg">
</span> or
<span class="no-break">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/f.svg">
  <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2+4.svg">
</span>.

### Side Throw
To perform a side throw, input
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1+3.svg"> or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2+4.svg"> when at your opponent's side. The
input used won't change the throw properties, except for certain character
such as King, who have unique left and right side throws.

### Back Throw
To perform a back throw, input
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1+3.svg"> or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2+4.svg"> when at your opponent's back. The
input used won't change the throw properties.

### Running Tackle
To perform a running tackle, run at the opponent for three to four steps. The
tackle will occur automatically. After a tackle, up to four punches can be
performed by pressing
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1.svg"> or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2.svg">.

## Command Throw
Command throws are an alternative to generic throws which are unique to each
character. Command throws typically do more damage than generic throws and leave
your opponent in a dangerous position.

## Breaking Throws

description="To break command throws, press the punch buttons corresponding to
the extended arms" %}

While throws can't be blocked, you can break most of them. To break
command throws, you need to press the punch buttons corresponding to what
arms your opponent extends.
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1.svg">
if the left arm is extended,
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2.svg">
if the right arm is extended, and
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1+2.svg">
if both arms are extended.

The throw break window is 0.33 seconds (20 frames). You only have one
opportunity to break a throw. If you fail to input a throw
break, or input the incorrect throw break, the throw becomes unbreakable.

Historically, generic throws and command throws were broken the same way.
This changed with Tekken 7. Generic throws are now broken by pressing
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1.svg"> or
<img class="icon" src="/assets/img/2.svg"> regardless of the extended arms,
but not <img class="icon" src="/assets/img/1+2.svg">. This change created a divide
between generic and command throws since they're significantly easier to break.
If you want to throw your opponent, its in your interests to use a command throw
instead of a generic throw.
