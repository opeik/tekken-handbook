# Throws
It can be challenging to break through the guard of defensive players
(this playstyle is known as turtling). One method of opening up opponents
is by using throws. Throws are high (except for special throws), but cannot be
blocked and must be broken. Because throws ignore guard, they are a reliable option
against turtling or to mix up your offence.

## Breaking Throws

While throws cannot be blocked, you can break most of them. To break
throws, you need to press the buttons corresponding to what arms your
opponent extends.

You only have one opportunity to break a throw. If you input
the incorrect throw break it becomes unbreakable. The throw break window is
0.33 seconds (20 frames). If you fail to input a throw
break in this window, the throw can't be broken.
